# Shadows of Doubt Floorplan Editor

A Unity-based tool for creating and editing floorplans for the game Shadows of Doubt.

The system works with a tile system, where each tile is assigned to an address type, and a room type.
Doors and windows are assigned on the connections between tiles.

## Working notes:

Each floorplan is surrounded by 3 grid tiles of null.
Each building has two default addresses - Outside, index 0. Lobby, index 1.
